# MiresChrono

MiresChrono is an interactive mapping project built using [QGIS2Web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). The project focuses on the Sävar Rising Coastline Mire Chronosequence (SMC) in the Swedish province of Västerbotten, part of the Bothnian Bay Lowlands (BBL).

## Project Overview

The Sävar Rising Coastline Mire Chronosequence (SMC) is a study area characterized by post-glacial isostatic rebound, currently at a rate of ~9 mm per year. This phenomenon has continuously exposed new land areas suitable for primary mire formation, creating a natural mire chronosequence spanning from the present coastline (0 years BP) to the highest coastline (~10,000 years BP). This age gradient provides a unique opportunity to study mire succession at the landscape level under similar present climatic conditions.

## Interactive Map Features

- **Field Photos**: Includes field photos from two separate transects in the SMC.
- **Searchable Mires**: Mires can be searched using their unique IDs.
- **Legend Box**: Allows users to set the background map to street, topographic, terrain, or satellite view.
- **Mire Details**: Clicking on a mire shape displays a landscape photo along with geographical properties. Clicking on a point displays a vegetation photo with sampling point data.

## Sampling and Monitoring

- **Sampling Transects**: Edge-to-edge sampling transects have been applied in 57 chronosequence mires (red points on the map), with one to four transects per mire and five sampling points each, covering within-mire variation in peat properties.
- **Sampling Points**: A total of 400 sampling points were visited during July and August 2018.
- **Groundwater Monitoring**: In 15 chronosequence mires (blue triangles on the map), relative and absolute groundwater levels have been continuously monitored for two years (2021-2023).
